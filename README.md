# Hate alert website 

*Hate alert** is a  small group of researchers at [CNeRG Lab](http://www.cnergres.iitkgp.ac.in/), [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/).
Their vision is to bring civility in online conversations by building systems to **analyse**, **detect** and **mitigate** hate in online social media. Recently, they have published papers in top conferences like AAAI, WWW, ICWSM and WebSci.
