Past research on detecting abusive language covers different platforms, languages, demographies, etc. However, models trained using these datasets do not perform well in cross-domain evaluation settings. To overcome this, a common strategy is to use a few samples from the target domain to train models to get better performance in that domain (cross-domain few-shot training). However, this might cause the models to overfit the artefacts of those samples. A compelling solution could be to guide the models toward rationales, i.e., spans of text that justify the text’s label. This method has been found to improve model performance in the in-domain setting across various NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose RGFS (Rationale-Guided Few-Shot Classification) for abusive language detection. We first build a multitask learning setup to jointly learn rationales, targets, and labels, and find a significant improvement of 6% macro F1 on the rationale detection task over training solely rationale classifiers. We introduce two rationale-integrated BERT-based architectures (the RGFS models) and evaluate our systems over five different abusive language datasets, finding that in the few-shot classification setting, RGFS-based models outperform baseline models by about 7% in macro F1 scores and perform competitively to models finetuned on other source domains.

This fear is so deeply ingrained that even the slightest “knock” to it could spark a violent conflict among different groups. Here, we demonstrate how social media platforms are used to extensively mediate elements of existential fear as fear speech posts. Their nontoxic and argumentative nature makes them appealing to even benign users who in turn contribute to their wide prevalence by resharing, liking, and replying to them. Remarkably, this prevalence is far stronger than the more well-known hate speech posts.

Owing to such heavy moderation, newer and more subtle techniques are being deployed. One of the most striking among these is fear speech. Fear speech, as the name suggests, attempts to incite fear about a target community. Although subtle, it might be highly effective, often pushing communities toward a physical conflict. Therefore, understanding their prevalence in social media is of paramount importance. This article presents a large-scale study to understand the prevalence of 400K fear speech and over 700K hate speech posts collected from Gab.com. Remarkably, users posting a large number of fear speech accrue more followers and occupy more central positions in social networks than users posting a large number of hate speech. They can also reach out to benign users more effectively than hate speech users through replies, reposts, and mentions. This connects to the fact that, unlike hate speech, fear speech has almost zero toxic content, making it look plausible. Moreover, while fear speech topics mostly portray a community as a perpetrator using a (fake) chain of argumentation, hate speech topics hurl direct multitarget insults, thus pointing to why general users could be more gullible to fear speech. Our findings transcend even to other platforms (Twitter and Facebook) and thus necessitate using sophisticated moderation policies and mass awareness to combat fear speech..","tags":["Our papers","counterspeech","English","Generation"],"title":"On the rise of fear speech in online social media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Mithun Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Mithun+Das\u0026btnG=)","Rohit Raj","[Punyajoy Saha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Punyajoy+Saha\u0026btnG=)","[Binny Mathew](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Binny+Mathew\u0026btnG=)","[Manish Gupta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eX9PSu0AAAAJ\u0026hl=en)","[Animesh Mukherjee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Animesh+Mukherjee\u0026btnG=)"],"categories":null,"content":"Main contributions Coming soon\nLimitations Coming soon\nFuture Directions Coming soon\n","date":1685664000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685664000,"objectID":"30989a402e050fc95d886f37cfcdd648","permalink":"/publication/das2023hatemm/","publishdate":"2023-06-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/das2023hatemm/","section":"publication","summary":"Hate speech has become one of the most significant issues inmodern society, having implications in both the online and theoffline world. Due to this, hate speech research has recentlygained a lot of traction. However, most of the work has pri-marily focused on text media with relatively little work on im-ages and even lesser on videos. Thus, early stage automatedvideo moderation techniques are needed to handle the videosthat are being uploaded to keep the platform safe and healthy.With a view to detect and remove hateful content from thevideo sharing platforms, our work focuses on hate video de-tection using multi-modalities. To this end, we curate∼43hours of videos from BitChute and manually annotate themas hate or non-hate, along with the frame spans which couldexplain the labelling decision. To collect the relevant videoswe  harnessed  search  keywords  from  hate  lexicons.  We  ob-serve various cues in images and audio of hateful videos. Fur-ther, we build deep learning multi-modal models to classifythe hate videos and observe that using all the modalities ofthe videos improves the overall hate speech detection perfor-mance (accuracy=0.798, macro F1-score=0.790) by∼5.7%compared to the best uni-modal model in terms of macro F1score. In summary, our work takes the first step toward under-standing and modeling hateful videos on video hosting plat-forms such as BitChute.","tags":["Our Papers","Detection","Abusive language","Multi-Modal"],"title":"HateMM: A Multi-Modal Dataset for Hate Video Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hate Alert"],"categories":null,"content":"Important updates  Slides can be found here Video of the tutorial can be found here!!

In this paper, we propose CounterGeDi - an ensemble of generative discriminators (GeDi) to guide the generation of a DialoGPT model toward more polite, detoxified, and emotionally laden counterspeech. We generate counterspeech using three datasets and observe significant improvement across different attribute scores. The politeness and detoxification scores increased by around 15% and 6% respectively, while the emotion in the counterspeech increased by at least 10% across all the datasets. We also experiment with triple-attribute control and observe significant improvement over single attribute results when combining complementing attributes, e.g., politeness, joyfulness and detoxification.

The following section presents a detailed plan for the tutorial:-\n Introduction (15 min)- This section will cover the scentific interest in hate speech and various definitions of hate speech. This section will help you understand the outline and what to take home from this tutorial. Analysis (20 min)- In this section, we analyze the spread of hate speech in online social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Gab etc. We observe that hate speech is spreading through online communities at an alarming rate. These hateful users are well connected among themselves and are reaching a wider audience. This case is more severe in moderation free platforms like Gab, Bitchute etc. The targets of such hate vary. These include the Muslims, Jews, Africans etc. This section is further divided into the following parts  Spread of hate speech Effects of hate speech Targets of hate speech   Detection (20 min)- Hate speech detection is a challenging task. We now have several datasets available based on different criterias language, domain, modalities etc.Several models ranging from simple Bag of Words to complex ones like BERT have been used for the task. The task performance seems to be improving over time, however, there are issues like generalizability, bias and explainability of the models. This section is further divided into  Different datasets. Earlier detection models Current detection models (based on transformers) Multimodal and Multilingual hate speech Hate user detection Challenge: Evaluation, Explainability and Bias   Mitigation (20 min)- To deter the spread of hate speech, organizations have adopted several policies. These include the general policies like deletion of posts and/or accounts, shadow banning to softer approaches like counterspeech. Policies like banning/deletion seem to be effective in some cases, but there are issues of violation of freedom of speech. Recent research have started looking into automated generation of counterspeech as well.  Banning and suspending users Counter speech detection Counter speech generation Challenges: Generation pitfalls, Moderation effects   Road to the future (15 min)- We end this tutorial with covering the summary of the challenges and road to the future for hate speech research.  Summary of challenges Branches and extensions of hate speech. Connections to offline violence. Guidelines for building better dataset. Adapting to newer events and platforms.

The current literature on hate speech detection leverages primarily the textual content to find hateful posts and subsequently identify hateful users. However, this methodology disregards the social connections between users. In this paper, we run a detailed exploration of the problem space and investigate an array of models ranging from purely textual to graph based to finally semi-supervised techniques using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that utilize both textual and graph-based features. We run exhaustive experiments on two datasets -- Gab, which is loosely moderated and Twitter, which is strictly moderated. Overall the AGNN model achieves 0.791 macro F1-score on the Gab dataset and 0.780 macro F1-score on the Twitter dataset using only 5% of the labeled instances, considerably outperforming all the other models including the fully supervised ones. We perform detailed error analysis on the best performing text and graph based models and observe that hateful users have unique network neighborhood signatures and the AGNN model benefits by paying attention to these signatures. This property, as we observe, also allows the model to generalize well across platforms in a zero-shot setting. Lastly, we utilize the best performing GNN model to analyze the evolution of hateful users and their targets over time in Gab.

Due to its popularity, WhatsApp has become a powerful and cheap tool for political campaigning being widely used during the 2019 Indian general election, where it was used to connect to the voters on a large scale. Along with the campaigning, there have been reports that WhatsApp has also become a breeding ground for harmful speech against various protected groups and religious minorities. Many such messages attempt to instil fear among the population about a specific (minority) community. According to research on inter-group conflict, such \"fear speech\" messages could have a lasting impact and might lead to real offline violence. In this paper, we perform the first large scale study on fear speech across thousands of public WhatsApp groups discussing politics in India. We curate a new dataset and try to characterize fear speech from this dataset. We observe that users writing fear speech messages use various events and symbols to create the illusion of fear among the reader about a target community. We build models to classify fear speech and observe that current state-of-the-art NLP models do not perform well at this task. Fear speech messages tend to spread faster and could potentially go undetected by classifiers built to detect traditional toxic speech due to their low toxic nature. Finally, using a novel methodology to target users with Facebook ads, we conduct a survey among the users of these WhatsApp groups to understand the types of users who consume and share fear speech. We believe that this work opens up new research questions that are very different from tackling hate speech which the research community has been traditionally involved in.","tags":["Our papers","Detection","Hindi","English","Fear speech"],"title":"Short is the Road that Leads from Fear to Hate: Fear Speech in Indian WhatsApp Groups","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Poojitha Maheshappa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Poojitha+Maheshappa\u0026btnG=)","[Binny Mathew](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Binny+Mathew\u0026btnG=)","[Punyajoy Saha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Punyajoy+Saha\u0026btnG=)"],"categories":null,"content":"Main contributions Coming soon\nLimitations Coming soon\nFuture Directions Coming soon\n","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"87c08ad66d9d55ee946fb0fed67f218f","permalink":"/publication/maheshappa2021using/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maheshappa2021using/","section":"publication","summary":" With the increasing cases of online hate speech, there is an urgentdemand for better hate speech detection systems.

While better models for hate speech detection are continuously being developed, there is little research on the bias and interpretability aspects of hate speech. In this paper, we introduce HateXplain, the first benchmark hate speech dataset covering multiple aspects of the issue. Each post in our dataset is annotated from three different perspectives: the basic, commonly used 3-class classification (i.e., hate, offensive or normal), the target community (i.e., the community that has been the victim of hate speech/offensive speech in the post), and the rationales, i.e., the portions of the post on which their labelling decision (as hate, offensive or normal) is based. We utilize existing state-of-the-art models and observe that even models that perform very well in classification do not score high on explainability metrics like model plausibility and faithfulness. We also observe that models, which utilize the human rationales for training, perform better in reducing unintended bias towards target communities.

Hence, we perform the first temporal analysis of hate speech on Gab.com, a social media site with very loose moderation policy. We first generatetemporal snapshotsof Gab from millions of posts and users. Using these temporal snapshots, we compute anactivity vectorbased on DeGroot model to identify hateful users. The amount of hate speech in Gab is steadily increasing and the new users are becoming hatefulat an increased and faster rate. Further, our analysis analysis reveals that the hate users are occupying the prominent positions in the Gab network. Also, the language used by the community as a whole seem tocorrelate more with that of the hateful users as compared to the non-hateful ones.

The prevalence of online hate speech has fueled horrific real-world hate-crime such as the mass-genocide of Rohingya Muslims, communal violence in Colombo and the recent massacre in the Pittsburgh synagogue. Consequently, It is imperative to understand the diffusion of such hateful content in an online setting. We conduct the first study that analyses the flow and dynamics of posts generated by hateful and non-hateful users on Gab (gab.com) over a massive dataset of 341K users and 21M posts. Our observations confirms that hateful content diffuse farther, wider and faster and have a greater outreach than those of non-hateful users. A deeper inspection into the profiles and network of hateful and non-hateful users reveals that the former are more influential, popular and cohesive. Thus, our research explores the interesting facets of diffusion dynamics of hateful users and broadens our understanding of hate speech in the online world.","tags":["English","Our papers"],"title":"Spread of hate speech in online social media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Maarten Sap](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Maarten+Sap\u0026btnG=)","[Dallas Card](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Dallas+Card\u0026btnG=)","[Saadia Gabriel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Saadia+Gabriel\u0026btnG=)","[Yejin Choi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Yejin+Choi\u0026btnG=)","[Noah A Smith](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Noah+A+Smith\u0026btnG=)"],"categories":null,"content":"Main contributions Coming soon\nLimitations Coming soon\nFuture Directions Coming soon\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b2fb5858a601378e4c471682b3f03e24","permalink":"/publication/sap2019risk/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sap2019risk/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigate how annotators insensitivity to differences in dialect can lead to racial bias in automatic hate speech detection models, potentially amplifying harm against minority populations.

While Facebook, Twitter, Google have attempted to take several steps to tackle the hateful content, they have mostly been unsuccessful. Counterspeech is seen as an effective way of tackling the online hate without any harm to the freedom of speech. Thus, an alternative strategy for these platforms could be to promote counterspeech as a defense against hate content. However, in order to have a successful promotion of such counterspeech, one has to have a deep understanding of its dynamics in the online world. Lack of carefully curated data largely inhibits such understanding. In this paper, we create and release the first ever dataset for counterspeech using comments from YouTube. The data contains 13,924 manually annotated comments where the labels indicate whether a comment is a counterspeech or not. This data allows us to perform a rigorous measurement study characterizing the linguistic structure of counterspeech for the first time. This analysis results in various interesting insights such as: the counterspeech comments receive much more likes as compared to the noncounterspeech comments, for certain communities majority of the non-counterspeech comments tend to be hate speech, the different types of counterspeech are not all equally effective and the language choice of users posting counterspeech is largely different from those posting non-counterspeech as revealed by a detailed psycholinguistic analysis. Finally, we build a set of machine learning models that are able to automatically detect counterspeech in YouTube videos with an F1-score of 0.71. We also build multilabel models that can detect different types of counterspeech in a comment with an F1-score of 0.60.","tags":["Counter speech","English","Our Papers"],"title":"Thou shalt not hate: Countering online hate speech","type":"publication"},{"authors":["[Thai Binh Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Thai+Binh+Nguyen\u0026btnG=)","[Quang Minh Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Quang+Minh+Nguyen\u0026btnG=)","[Thu Hien Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Thu+Hien+Nguyen\u0026btnG=)","[Ngoc Phuong Pham](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Ngoc+Phuong+Pham\u0026btnG=)","[The Loc Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=The+Loc+Nguyen\u0026btnG=)","[Quoc Truong Do](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors\u0026hl=en\u0026mauthors=Quoc+Truong+Do\u0026btnG=)"],"categories":null,"content":"Main contributions Coming soon\nLimitations Coming soon\nFuture Directions Coming soon\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"9ef959e23a3042650bbb0e9bad7bfc24","permalink":"/publication/nguyen2019vais/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nguyen2019vais/","section":"publication","summary":"Nowadays, Social network sites (SNSs) such as Facebook, Twitter are common places where people show their opinions, sentiments and share information with others.
