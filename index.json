In particular, when working with scientific software, such issues in the documentation pose a risk to producing reliable scientific results as they may cause improper or incorrect use of the software. R is a popular programming language for scientific software with a prolific package-based ecosystem, where users contribute packages (i.e., libraries). R packages are intended to be reused, and their users rely extensively on the available documentation. Thus, understanding what information developers provide in their packages’ documentation (generally, through a system known as Roxygen, based on Javadoc) is essential to contribute to it. This study mined 379 GitHub repositories of R packages and analysed a sample to develop a taxonomy of natural language descriptions used in Roxygen documentation. This was done through hybrid card sorting, which included two experienced R developers. The resulting taxonomy covers parameters, returns, and descriptions, providing a baseline for further studies. Our taxonomy is the first of its kind for R. Based on previous studies in pure object-oriented languages, our taxonomy could be extensible to other dynamically-typed languages used in scientific programming.","tags":null,"title":"Towards a Taxonomy of Roxygen Documentation in R Packages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ken Russel Go","Sruthi Soundarapandian","Aparupa Mitra","Melina Vidoni","Nicolás E.

Such _simple stupid insecure practices (SSIPs)_ can have severe security implications for package-based software systems, as they are easily spread over version-control systems. Moreover, GitHub is piloting regular-expression-based code searches _across public repositories_ through its Code Search Technology, potentially simplifying unearthing SSIPs. As an exploratory case study, we focused on popular PyPi packages and analysed their source code using regular expressions (as done by GitHub's incoming search engine). The goal was to explore how _detectable_ these simple vulnerabilities are and how exploitable Code Search Technology is. Results show that packages on lower versions are more vulnerable, that code injection is the most scattered issue, and that about 20% of the scouted packages have at least one vulnerability.

In this work, we provided some empirical insights in this regard with the aim of paving the road for future investigations. Overall, our results suggest the need for further research assessing the usability of the current privacy-enhancing mechanism available in SCPs. That is, to determine whether such mechanisms meet users\u0026rsquo; individual and collective goals of transparency, access control, and anonymity.\nDevelopers\u0026rsquo; knowledge and perception of privacy threats also call for additional research efforts, as it is critical to assess their (potential) lack of awareness in order to outline adequate cybersecurity training programs. The role of risk awareness in the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies has been thoroughly studied and documented across the OSN literature (Oukemeni et al., 2019). In future work, we plan to delve into the interplay between risk awareness and privacy-related behaviour in SCPs. Particularly, on developers\u0026rsquo; knowledge about potential privacy threats (e.g., secrets sprawl or code re-attribution) and their adoption of cybersecurity best practices (e.g., see Krause et al., (2022)).\n\nCitation @inproceedings{DiazFerreyra2023,\rauthor = {Ferreyra, Nicolás E.

However, unlike in OSNs, the privacy concerns and practices of SCP users have not been extensively explored nor documented in the current literature. In this work, we present the preliminary results of an online survey (`N=105`) addressing developers' concerns and perceptions about privacy threats steaming from SCPs. Our results suggest that, although users express concern about social and organisational privacy threats, they often feel safe sharing personal and project-related information on these platforms. Moreover, attacks targeting the inference of sensitive attributes are considered more likely than those seeking to re-identify source-code contributors.

However, scientific software coded in dynamically-typed languages such as R differs in paradigm, and the source code comments' semantics are different (i.e., more aligned with algorithms and statistics when compared to traditional software). Additionally, many Software Engineering topics are understudied in scientific software development, with SATD detection remaining a challenge for this domain. This gap adds complexity since prior works determined SATD in scientific software does not adjust to many of the keywords identified for OO SATD, possibly hindering its automated detection. Therefore, we investigated how classification models (traditional machine learning, deep neural networks, and deep neural Pre-Trained Language Models (PTMs)) automatically detect SATD in R packages. This study aims to study the capabilities of these models to classify different TD types in this domain and manually analyze the causes of each in a representative sample. Our results show that PTMs (i.e., RoBERTa) outperform other models and work well when the number of comments labelled as a particular SATD type has low occurrences. We also found that some SATD types are more challenging to detect. We manually identified sixteen causes, including eight new causes detected by our study. The most common cause was _failure to remember_, in agreement with previous studies. These findings will help the R package authors automatically identify SATD in their source code and improve their code quality. In the future,  checklists for R developers can also be developed by scientific communities such as rOpenSci to guarantee a higher quality of packages before submission.","tags":null,"title":"Self-Admitted Technical Debt in R: Detection and Causes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Melina Vidoni","Laura Cunico"],"categories":null,"content":"\nContributions Overall, our study uncovered modellers\u0026rsquo; tendency to refactor and polish the final model and use version control and very detailed comments. Nonetheless, we discovered traces of negative practices regarding Code and Documentation Debt (e.g., dead and duplicated code, and outdated or incomplete documentation). We also observed hints that TD appears to be deliberately introduced, with modellers being aware that their practices are not the best\u0026ndash;this seems to align with prior findings related to scientific software practices. We also highlight four future areas of work to continue unveiling what TD means for OR. Finally, although the goal may be ambitious, this paper aspires to stimulate reflective thinking and promote a novel and different line of action and research among OR practitioners in search of two goals. First, achieving better programming habits during model development, and second, approaching SE research in OR programming.\n\nEthics Declarations The authors have no relevant financial or non-financial interests to disclose.

Mathematical programming has been considered 'special purpose programming', meant to program and simulate particular problem types (e.g., symbolic mathematics through Matlab). Likewise, more traditional mathematical programming has been considered 'modelling programming' to program models by providing programming structures required for mathematical formulations (e.g., GAMS, AMPL, AIMMS). Because of this, other authors have argued the need to consider mathematical programming as closely related to software development. As a result, this paper presents a novel exploration of TD in mathematical programming by assessing self-reported practices through a survey, which gathered 168 complete responses. This study discovered potential debts manifested through _smells_ and attitudinal causes towards them. Results uncovered a trend to refactor and polish the final mathematical model and use version control and detailed comments. Nonetheless, we uncovered traces of negative practices regarding _Code Debt_ and _Documentation Debt_, alongside hints indicating that most TD is deliberately introduced (i.e., modellers are aware that their practices are not the best). We aim to discuss the idea that TD is also present in mathematical programming and that it may hamper the reproducibility and maintainability of the models created. The overall goal is to outline future areas of work that can lead to changing current modellers' habits and assist in extending existing mathematical programming (both practice and research) to eventually manage TD in mathematical programming.","tags":null,"title":"On Technical Debt in Mathematical Programming: An Exploratory Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shubhashis Karmakar","Zadia Codabux","Melina Vidoni"],"categories":null,"content":"\nPreliminary Results Although we successfully classified PRCs as TD and non-TD and the TD comments as explicit and implicit, the classification process was challenging. We found that PRCs often lack the context to understand it and correctly classify it. Some PRCs were potential TD, but we could not determine whether they will eventually become a TD instance using only information in the PRC. PRCs were often ambiguous and hard to understand due to the natural language in which they were written, and the terminologies and vocabulary used differ among the developers. Lastly, more than one PRC could be related to the same debt instance, or multiple debt instances may be discussed in a PRC. We discussed some mitigation strategies for these challenges.\n\nCitation @inproceedings{Karmakar2022,\rauthor = {Karmakar, Shubhashis and Codabux, Zadia and Vidoni, Melina},\rtitle = \u0026quot;{An Experience Report on Technical Debt in Pull Requests: Challenges and Lessons Learned}\u0026quot;,\ryear = {2022},\risbn = {9781450394277},\rpublisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},\raddress = {New York, USA},\rdoi = {10.1145/3544902.3546637},\rbooktitle = {16th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement},\rpages = {295–300},\rnumpages = {6},\rkeywords = {Mining Software Repositories, Technical Debt, Pull Request Comments},\rlocation = {Helsinki, Finland},\rseries = {ESEM '22}\r}\r","date":1655856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655856000,"objectID":"fc8d1d8ce05b354fbf6996048b5a4871","permalink":"/publication/2022-tdissues/","publishdate":"2022-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-tdissues/","section":"publication","summary":"GitHub is a collaborative platform for global software development, where Pull Requests (PRs) are essential to bridge code changes with version control. However, software developers often trade software quality for faster implementation, incurring Technical Debt (TD). When PRs are evaluated by reviewers (e.g., other developers), the latter can often detect TD instances, and this can lead to either rejection of the PR or can spark discussion about it. We investigated whether PRs' comments indicate TD by assessing three large-scale repositories: Spark, Kafka, and React. We combined a manual classification with automated detection using machine learning and deep learning models. We classified two datasets and found that 37.7% and 38.7% of the comments indicate TD, respectively. Our best model achieved an 85% F1 score in classifying TD during the validation phase. However, we also faced several challenges during this process, which may hint that TD in PR comments is discussed differently from other software artifacts (e.g., code comments, commits, issues or discussion forums). Thus, we present challenges and lessons learned meant to assist researchers in pursuing this area of research.","tags":null,"title":"An Experience Report on Technical Debt in Pull Requests: Challenges and Lessons Learned","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pranav Chandramouli","Zadia Codabux","Melina Vidoni"],"categories":null,"content":"Highlights Therefore, analyzeR was designed to assist with static code analysis on three types of R\u0026rsquo;s OO implementations (S3, S4, and R6) while maintaining a seamless, unique and user-friendly process.

In the last decade, there have been significant advances regarding TD management (TDM). However, research about incorporating TDM into the software development lifecycle remains scarce, and existing approaches aim to control TD through different processes. This proposal leverages the concept of infinite games from game theory to posit a different perspective. We argue that TD cannot be entirely removed and that its effects or consequences cannot be considered 'managed' even when an occurrence (i.e., a smell) is repaid. Rather than using a mathematical approach, we present TDM in terms of the four components of infinite games (players, rules, goals, and time), its tradeoffs and relationships, to discuss its potential impact on TDM activities. As this is an incipient area, our goal is to motivate a change of mindset regarding TDM, stimulating reflective thinking and thus, posing a new line of research. We conclude with a series of potential research questions organised into three key areas.","tags":null,"title":"Infinite Technical Debt","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pranjay Kumar","Davin Ie","Melina Vidoni"],"categories":null,"content":"\nPreliminary Results Preliminary results indicate that coverage calculations are prone to manipulation since developers alter it with the nocov tags in comments.

R is a package-based programming ecosystem that provides an easy way to install third-party code, datasets, tests, documentation and examples. This structure makes it especially vulnerable to TTD because errors present in a package can transitively affect all packages and scripts that depend on it. Thus, TTD can effectively become a threat to the validity of all analysis written in R that rely on potentially faulty code. This two-part study provides the first analysis in this area. First, 177 systematically-selected, open-source R packages were mined and analysed to address quality of testing, testing goals, and identify potential TTD sources. Second, a survey addressed how R package developers perceive testing and face its challenges (response rate of 19.4%). Results show that testing in R packages is of low quality; the most common smells are inadequate and obscure unit testing, improper asserts, inexperienced testers and improper test design. Furthermore, skilled R developers still face challenges such as time constraints, emphasis on development rather than testing, poor tool documentation and a steep learning curve.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluating Unit Testing Practices in R Packages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Melina Vidoni"],"categories":null,"content":"\nContributions More than 164k of comments were manually read and classified into 12 types of TD.

Although previous studies have demonstrated that SATD is common in software projects and negatively impacts their maintenance, they have mostly approached software systems coded in traditional object-oriented programming (OOP), such as Java, C++ or .NET. This paper studies SATD in R packages and reports the results of a three-part study. The first part mined more than 500 R packages available on GitHub and analysed more than 164k of comments to generate a dataset. The second part administered crowd-sourcing to analyse the quality of the extracted comments, while the third part conducted a survey to address developers' perspectives regarding SATD comments. The main findings indicate that a large amount of outdated code is left commented, with SATD accounting for about 3% of comments. Code Debt was the most common type, but there were also traces of Algorithm Debt, and there is a considerable amount of comments dedicated to circumventing CRAN checks. Moreover, package authors seldom address the SATD they encounter and often add it as self-reminders.","tags":null,"title":"Self-Admitted Technical Debt in R Packages: An Exploratory Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zadia Codabux","Melina Vidoni","Fatemeh Fard"],"categories":null,"content":"\nContributions The main contributions of this study are as follows:\n  This is the first study that investigates TD in the R package peer-reviewing documentation.

Although TD studies have gained momentum, TD has yet to be studied as thoroughly in non-object-oriented or scientific software such as R. R is a multi-paradigm programming language, whose popularity in data science and statistical applications has amplified in recent years. Due to R's inherent ability to expand through user-contributed packages, several community-led organizations were created to organize and peer-review packages in a concerted effort to increase their quality. Nonetheless, it is well-known that most R users do not have a technical programming background, being from multiple disciplines.\n**Objective:** The goal of this study is to investigate TD in the documentation of the peer-review of R packages led by rOpenSci.\n**Method:** We collected over 5,000 comments from 157 packages that had been reviewed and approved to be published at rOpenSci. We manually analyzed a sample dataset of these comments posted by package authors, editors of rOpenSci, and reviewers during the review process to investigate the types of TD present in these reviews.\n**Results:** The findings of our study include (i) a taxonomy of TD derived from our analysis of the peer-reviews (ii) documentation debt as being the most prevalent type of debt (iii) different user roles are concerned with different types of TD. For instance, reviewers tend to report some types of TD more than other roles, and the types of TD they report are different from those reported by the authors of a package.\n**Conclusion:** TD analysis in scientific software or peer-review is almost non-existent. Our study is a pioneer, but within the context of R packages. However, our findings can serve as a starting point for replication studies, given our public datasets, to perform similar analyses in other scientific software or to investigate the rationale behind our findings.","tags":null,"title":"Technical Debt in the Peer-Review Documentation of R Packages: a rOpenSci Case Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Melina Vidoni"],"categories":null,"content":"\nContributions The main contributions of this study are as follows:\n  Historical review of Operational Research (OR)\n  Historical review of Software Engineering (SE)\n  Proposal of a new area of work for OR: OR-Engineering, and five research areas.\n  \n\nAcknowledgements The author also gratefully acknowledges the editors and anonymous reviewers of the manuscript for their thorough reading, thoughtful and insightful comments and suggestions.

This proposal is substantiated by an empirical study that explored OR history and the rise of “wicked problems” in contrast to Software Engineering (SE) history and the idea of “no silver bullet”. The main findings are five areas for future works, intertwined between Soft OR and OR Engineering: agility, documentation of versioning, technical debt, systems testing and architecture.

This is done to discover where and how errors are happening, simplifying its correction while evaluating their possible ramifications.

However, these issues have already been acknowledged, addressed and solved in the Software Engineering (SE) discipline. Thus, considering the current contributions from SE to OR projects, and the solutions offered by the first, this article analyses more deeply the similarities existing in the lifecycles of projects aiming to narrow the gap that exists in OR research, due to the lack of project methodologies. A proposal is made regarding the flow of information refinement and lifecycle phases predominant in OR projects; an initial theoretical adaptation of Feature Driven Development showcases their potential and possibilities.

Therefore, two views are presented, which are based on the '4+1' View Model endorsed by the international standard ISO/IEC 42010:2011; those Views are represented using UML diagrams and they are described including variation points for a number of possible situations.","tags":null,"title":"Towards a Reference Architecture for Advanced Planning Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinbin Zhu","Aldo Vecchietti"],"categories":null,"content":"Acknowledgements The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for the work presented in this article to CONICET through Project PIP 688, ANPCyT with Grant PICT2012 2484 and Universidad Tecnológica Nacional through PID 25/O152.\n\nCitation @article{Vidoni2015a,\rtitle = {A systemic approach to define and characterize Advanced Planning Systems (APS)},\rjournal = {Computers \u0026amp; Industrial Engineering},\rvolume = {90},\rpages = {326-338},\ryear = {2015},\rissn = {0360-8352},\rdoi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2015.10.006},\rurl = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036083521500399X},\rauthor = {Melina C.

An APS must be integrated to the Enterprise’s System (such as an ERP), but this task usually lacks of a specific methodology to be performed and is generally made ad-hoc. With the ultimate objective to provide an approach to facilitate this integration, this work presents a characterization of the APS from a systemic point of view, using standardized Software Engineering concepts. The idea is to provide a definition and characterization of Advanced Planning Systems, by establishing the main goals of this type of system, and considering Functional Requirements, Quality Attributes and a reference model for the architecture. The selected choices are established on the base of several international standards from the Software Engineering area, such as the SEBoK (System Engineering Body of Knowledge) and the SQuaRE (Software product Quality Requirements and Evaluation) model, among others, and aim to serve as a base line for the general concept of APS.","tags":null,"title":"A systemic approach to define and characterize Advanced Planning Systems (APS)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Research"],"content":"","date":1446695100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1446695100,"objectID":"8ee090cd040adff3a9a91564e4ff86cc","permalink":"/new/2015-rutgers-symp/","publishdate":"2015-11-05T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/new/2015-rutgers-symp/","section":"new","summary":"","tags":["host/pathogen","compbio-bioinfo","lipid-metabolism"],"title":"Stochastic nature of adipogenic and inflammatory responses in tuberculous macrophages","type":"new"},{"authors":["Melina Vidoni","Aldo Vecchietti"],"categories":null,"content":"Acknowledgements The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for the work presented in this article to CONICET through Project PIP 688, ANPCYT with grant PICT2012 2484 and Universidad Tecnológica Nacional through PID 25/O152.\n\nCitation @article{Vidoni2015b,\rtitle = {An intelligent agent for ERP's data structure analysis based on ANSI/ISA-95 standard},\rjournal = {Computers in Industry},\rvolume = {73},\rpages = {39-50},\ryear = {2015},\rissn = {0166-3615},\rdoi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2015.07.011},\rurl = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361515300294},\rauthor = {Melina C.

The knowledge base of the agent is generated using the manufacturing categories information provided by mentioned standard. The approach proposes an infrastructure of a knowledge-based agent that interacts with the database of an ERP system, in order to classify the information of ERP's database tables according to the standard. Several study cases are evaluated and the results obtained are shown in different graphs. This is a first step to improve the interoperability between an Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) system that needs to be integrated with ERP's especially in manufacturing and production companies.","tags":null,"title":"An Intelligent Agent for ERP's Data Structure Analysis Based on ANSI/ISA-95 Standard","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinbin Zhu","Aldo Vecchietti"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1415836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1415836800,"objectID":"7c8f37851dc42cde28f89d2620878b98","permalink":"/publication/2014-graced-conaiisi/","publishdate":"2014-11-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-graced-conaiisi/","section":"publication","summary":"Los cambios en las organizaciones y la búsqueda de la integración, ha generado una necesidad de estandarizar las estructuras de datos empleadas para compartir información, con el objetivo de aumentar la eficiencia del flujo de información.

E2OL no se ata a un ERP, sistema de gestión de bases de datos, optimizador o modelos matemáticos, habilitando la modificación controlada del mismo y su adaptabilidad a diversos entornos; se trata de un sistema desarrollado en Java, portable y amigable al usuario que permite considerar las características más particulares de cada negocio donde se implemente.
