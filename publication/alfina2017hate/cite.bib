 abstract = {The objective of our work is to detect hate speech in the Indonesian language. As far as we know, the research on this subject is still very rare. The only research we found has created a dataset for hate speech against religion, but the quality of this dataset is inadequate. Our research aimed to create a new dataset that covers hate speech in general, including hatred for religion, race, ethnicity, and gender. In addition, we also conducted a preliminary study using machine learning approach. Machine learning so far is the most frequently used},
