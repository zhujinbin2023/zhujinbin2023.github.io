 abstract = {Religious hate speech in the Arabic Twittersphere is a notable problem that requires developing automated tools to detect messages that use inflammatory sectarian language to promote hatred and violence against people on the basis of religious affiliation. Distinguishing hate speech from other profane and vulgar language is quite a challenging task that requires deep linguistic analysis. The richness of the Arabic morphology and the limited available resources for the Arabic language make this task even more challenging},
