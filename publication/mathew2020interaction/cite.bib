 abstract = {Social media platforms usually tackle the proliferation of hate speech by blocking/suspending the message or account. One of the major drawback of such measures is the restriction of free speech. In this paper, we investigate the interaction of hatespeech and the responses that counter it (aka counter-speech). One of the prime contribution of this work is that we developed and released1 a dataset where we annotate pairs of hate and counter users.},
